### 0.6.0 (May 25, 2025)
- Headplane 0.6.0 now requires **Headscale 0.26.0** or newer.
    - Breaking API changes with routes and pre auth keys are now supported (closes [#204](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/204)).
    - Older versions of Headscale will not work with Headplane.

- OIDC authorization restrictions can now be controlled from the settings UI. (closes [#102](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/102))
	- The required permission role for this is **IT Admin** or **Admin/Owner** and require the Headscale configuration.
	- Changes made will modify the `oidc.allowed_{domains,groups,users}` fields in the Headscale config file.
- The Pre-Auth keys page has been fully reworked (closes [#179](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/179), [#143](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/143)).
- The Headplane agent is now available as an integration (closes [#65](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/65)).
	- The agent runs as an embedded process alongside the Headplane server and reports host information and system metrics.
	- Refer to the `integrations.agent` section of the config file for more information and how to enable it.
- Requests to `/admin` will now be redirected to `/admin/` to prevent issues with the React Router (works with custom prefixes, closes [#173](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/173)).
- The Login page has been simplified and separately reports errors versus incorrect API keys (closes [#186](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/186)).
- The machine actions backend has been reworked to better handle errors and provide more information to the user (closes [#185](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/185)).
- Machine tags now show states when waiting for subnet or exit node approval and when expiry is disabled.
- Expiry status on the UI was incorrectly showing as never due to changes in the Headscale API.
- Added validation for machine renaming to prevent invalid submissions (closes [#192](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/192)).
- Unmanaged (non-OIDC) users cannot have a role assigned to them so the menu option was disabled.
- Support Docker container discovery through labels (via [#194](https://github.com/tale/headplane/pull/194)).
- AAAA records are now supported on the DNS page (closes [#189](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/189)).
- Add support for `dns.extra_records_path` in the Headscale config (closes [#144](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/144)).
- Tighten `proc` integration logic by checking for the `headscale serve` command (via #[195](https://github.com/tale/headplane/pull/195)).
- Strip newlines in the OIDC `client_secret_path` file if provided (closes [#199](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/199)).

### 0.5.10 (April 4, 2025)
- Fix an issue where other preferences to skip onboarding affected every user.

### 0.5.9 (April 3, 2025)
- Filter out empty users from the pre-auth keys page which could possibly cause a crash with unmigrated users.

### 0.5.8 (April 3, 2025)
- You can now skip the onboarding page if desired.
- Added the UI to change user roles in the dashboard.
- Fixed an issue where integrations would throw instead of loading properly.
- Loading the ACL page no longer spams blank updates to the Headscale database (fixes [#151](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/151))
- Automatically create `/var/lib/headplane` in the Docker container (fixes [#166](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/166))
- OIDC logout with `disable_api_key_login` set to true will not automatically login again (fixes [#149](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/149))

### 0.5.7 (April 2, 2025)
- Hotfix an issue where assets aren't served under `/admin` or the prefix.

### 0.5.6 (April 2, 2025)

### IMPORTANT
> **PLEASE** update to this ASAP if you were using Google OIDC. This is because previously *ANY* accounts have admin access to your Tailnet if they discover the URL that Headplane is being hosted on. This new change enforces that new logins by default are not given any permissions. You will need to re-login to Headplane to generate an owner account and prevent unauthorized access.

Implemented *proper* authentication methods for OIDC.
This is a large update and copies the permission system from Tailscale.
Permissions are not automatically derived from OIDC, but they can be configured via the UI.
Additionally, certain roles give certain capabilities, limiting access to parts of the dashboard.
By default, new users will have a `member` role which forbids access to the UI.
If there are no users, the first user will be given an `owner` role which cannot be removed.

**Changes**:
- Switched the internal server to use `hono` for better performance.
- Fixed an issue that caused dialogs to randomly refocus every 3 seconds.
- Headplane will not send API requests when the tab is not focused.
- Continue loosening the configuration requirements for Headscale (part of an ongoing effort).
- Unknown values in the Headplane config no longer cause a crash.
- Fixed an issue that caused copied commands to have a random space (fixes [#161](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/161))

### 0.5.5 (March 18, 2025)
- Hotfix an issue that caused Headplane to crash if no agents are available

### 0.5.4 (March 18, 2025)
- Fixed a typo in the Kubernetes documentation
- Handle split and global DNS records not being set in the Headscale config (via [#129](https://github.com/tale/headplane/pull/129))
- Stop checking for the `mkey:` prefix on machine registration (via [#131](https://github.com/tale/headplane/pull/131))
- OIDC auth was not using information from the `user_info` endpoint.
- Support the picture of the user who is logged in via OIDC if available.
- Rewrote the Agent implementation to better utilize disk space and perform better (coming soon).
- Loosened checking for the Headscale configuration as it was too strict and required certain optional fields.
- Deleting a node will now correctly redirect back to the nodes page (fixes [#137](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/137))
- Supports connecting to Headscale via TLS and can accept a certificate file (partially fixes [#82](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/82))
- Add support for running Headplane through Nix, though currently unsupported (via [#132](https://github.com/tale/headplane/pull/132))
- You can now pass in an OIDC client secret through `oidc.client_secret_path` in the config (fixes [#126](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/126))
- Correctly handle differently localized number inputs (fixes [#125](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/125))

### 0.5.3 (March 1, 2025)
- Fixed an issue where Headplane expected the incorrect config value for OIDC scope (fixes [#111](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/111))

- Completely redesigned the UI from the ground up for accessibility and performance.
- Switched to a config-file setup (this introduces breaking changes, see [config.example.yaml](/config.example.yaml) for the new format).
