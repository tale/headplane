### 0.5.2 (February 28, 2025)
- Hotfixed an issue where the server bundle got reloaded on each request

### 0.5.1 (February 28, 2025)
- Fixed an issue that caused the entire server to crash on start
- Fixed the published semver tags from Docker
- Fixed the Kubernetes integration not reading the config

### 0.5 (February 27, 2025)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This release introduces breaking changes. Headplane version 0.5.0 and above expect Headscale's oidc.scope to be a string instead of an array. (Change `scope: ["openid", "profile", "email"]` to `scope: "openid profile email"`) If not changed, https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/111 will occur and Headplane will be limited to Simple Mode.

- Completely redesigned the UI from the ground up for accessibility and performance.
- Switched to a config-file setup (this introduces breaking changes, see [config.example.yaml](/config.example.yaml) for the new format).
- If the config is read-only, the options are still visible, just disabled (fixes [#48](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/48))
- Added support for Headscale 0.25.0 (this drops support for any older versions).
- Fixed issues where renaming, deleting, and changing node owners via users was not possible (fixes [#91](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/91))
- Operations now have significantly less moving parts and better error handling.
- Updated to `pnpm` 10 and Node.js 22.
- Settings that were previously shared like `public_url` or `oidc` are now separate within Headplane/Headscale. This is a rather large breaking change but fixes cases where a user may choose to utilize Headscale OIDC for Tailscale but not for the Headplane UI.
- Deprecate the `latest` tag in Docker for explicit versioning and `edge` for nightly builds.

### 0.4.1 (January 18, 2025)
- Fixed an urgent issue where the OIDC redirect URI would mismatch.

### 0.4.0 (January 18, 2025)
- Switched from Remix.run to React-Router
- Fixed an issue where some config fields were marked as required even if they weren't (fixes [#66](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/66))
- Fixed an issue where the toasts would be obscured by the footer (fixes [#68](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/68))
- The footer now blurs your Headscale URL as a privacy measure
- Updated to the next stable beta of the React Compiler
- Changed `/healthz` to use a well-known endpoint instead of trying an invalid API key
- Support `OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` to force a specific redirect URI
- Redo the OIDC integration for better error handling and configuration
- Gracefully handle when Headscale is unreachable instead of crashing the dashboard
- Reusable Pre-Auth Keys no longer show expired when used (PR [#88](https://github.com/tale/headplane/pull/88))
- Tweaked some CSS issues in the UI

### 0.3.9 (December 6, 2024)

- Allow `HEADSCALE_PUBLIC_URL` to be set if `HEADSCALE_URL` points to a different internal address (fixes [#60](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/60))
- Fixed an issue where the copy machine registration command had a typo.

### 0.3.6 (November 20, 2024)
- Fixed an issue where select dropdowns would not scroll (fixes [#53](https://github.com/tale/headplane/issues/53))
