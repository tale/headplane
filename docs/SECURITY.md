# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability within Headplane, please report it
directly via the GitHub security advisory system. Please include as much
information as possible, what the implications are, and a deterministic way
to reproduce the issue. This will help me to quickly assess and address the
vulnerability.
